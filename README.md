A Lightweight and fully asynchronous WebSocket client library based on [libev] for Embedded Linux.
And provide Lua-binding.

This has been modified to conditionally check if it's being built in emscripten, and use the browser API for websockets, if it has.

This will allow for websocet clients that work in love/lovejs, for example.


# Why should I choose libev?
 libev tries to follow the UNIX toolbox philosophy of doing one thing only, as good as possible.

# Features
* Lightweight - 35KB（Using glibc,stripped）
* Fully asynchronous - Use [libev] as its event backend
* Support ssl - OpenSSL, mbedtls and CyaSSl(wolfssl)
* Code structure is concise and understandable, also suitable for learning
* Lua-binding

# Dependencies
* [libev]
* [openssl] - If you choose openssl as your SSL backend
* [mbedtls(polarssl)] - If you choose mbedtls as your SSL backend
* [cyassl(wolfssl)] - If you choose wolfssl as your SSL backend
* [lua-ev] - If you use Lua

# Install dependent packages

    sudo apt install libev-dev libssl-dev

# Build and install

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/zhaojh329/libuwsc.git
	cd libuwsc
	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake ..
	make && sudo make install
	
# Install on OpenWrt

    opkg update
    opkg list | grep libuwsc
    opkg install libuwsc-nossl

If the install command fails, you can [compile it yourself](/BUILDOPENWRT.md).
